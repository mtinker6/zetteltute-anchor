**This project was submitted as part of the [2023 Grizzlython Hackathon](https://solana.com/grizzlython) and serves just for demo purposes and learning**

Background Information:
* [What is a Data Clean Room?](https://infotrust.com/articles/data-clean-room-ads-data-hub/)
* [TSE](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technische_Sicherheitseinrichtung)

### Prerequisits ###

* Solana
* Rust
* Anchor Framework
* Node.js

### Build, Test & deploy ###

```% anchor build ```

```% anchor test```

*(Negative testing with exception didn't work for me, look at the ```Using other account to add receipt ...``` test as an example.)*

### App Inegration with REST Enpoints ###

REST endpoints and triggers for Firebase are in `scripts/solanaFunctions.js`

***Some/most string information was reducted and obfuscated with `*** obfuscated ***` to not expose possible sensitive information of the underlying system.***

*The script is messy and was hacked togehter with code duplication and so on. But, IT WORKS!! ;)*
